"""S2 x WSF x AEF: the ground as a picture beside one H3 fill, one camera.

Two maps in one widget. LEFT: Earth Genome's Sentinel-2 yearly mosaic (true
color, 2022-2025) as tiles the kernel renders from the COGs; it is never
covered. RIGHT: one opaque H3 fill per hexagon over the same camera, from two
sources folded onto the same cells:

  WSF Tracker (DLR / MindEarth, GeoZarr on source.coop): one int8 per 10 m
  pixel, the half-year the pixel first read as built-up (1 = by July 2016 ..
  20 = by January 2026, 0 = never). Native pixels are sampled on a stride
  that fits a budget (the pyramid is a min and cannot be folded; it draws the
  right pane below the hexagon zoom). Per cell: the share built-up by the end
  of the window, the share that became built-up INSIDE the window, and the
  year most of that new ground arrived.

  AlphaEarth (Google DeepMind, COG overviews on source.coop): the cell's mean
  64-vector per year; the displacement between the two ends of the window
  (1 - cos), and the first year inside it the fingerprint jumped past the
  view's quiet level, set by the cells WSF says did not grow.

The window (from year, to year) is the one control both sides read. The
build-year fill and the AEF change-year fill share one palette, so a hexagon
that agrees is the same color on both.

The fold is the H3 UDF inside DataFusion (repo rule): every raster's pixels
cross as one Dataset and the cell is the GROUP BY. Nothing is tessellated in
the kernel; the browser gets cell ids and rgba.

Overture's division lines and the county join were here (Stephen,
2026-09-02, at the New Capital: "we're not joining this massive data at
country or even county level, they're not helpful, i say remove"). The fold
is per hexagon; an admin line told it nothing. Gone with them: the gold lines,
the hover name, the county tables, key B. The file name and the molab badge
still say overture; rename them when this moves to its own repo (Stephen,
2026-09-02: "i'm gonna probably move this to a new repo anyway").

    # The S2 settlement pair

    **Left**: the Sentinel-2 yearly mosaic, a picture, never covered. **Right**:
    one H3 fill over the same camera. Pan either map and both move. Hover a
    hexagon on either side and its ring is drawn on both.

    - **S2** (left header, a slider, the arrow keys or `[` `]`): which
      mosaic, 2022 to 2025; the picture follows the drag. The maps' own
      keyboard is off, so the arrows work after a click on either map. The `scale` slider is a gain on
      the picture. Where the yearly mosaic has a
      hole (2022 over Nusantara: cloud all year), the same year's temporal
      median (Earth Genome's other composite, 2022-2023) shows through, and
      the status line says what share of the pixels came from it. **FIND** under them: a Photon
      geocoder; the hits drop down as you type, arrows or the mouse pick one,
      Enter or a click flies both maps there.
    - **FILL** (keys `1` to `5`): **WSF built**, the record itself as a
      raster, the half-year each 10 m pixel first read as built-up, one color
      per year (no hexagons) · **WSF grew**, the share of the hexagon that
      became built-up inside the window · **WSF build year**, the year most of that
      new ground arrived, one color per year · **AEF changed**, how far the
      AlphaEarth fingerprint moved between the two ends of the window, on a
      ramp · **AEF change year**, the first year inside the window the
      fingerprint jumped past the quiet level, the same colors per year.
    - **WINDOW** (the slider, keys `-` `=` for the from end and `_` `+` for
      the to end): whole years 2017 to 2025, read by both sources. Drag either
      handle; the frame is rebuilt when you let go (WSF is folded once per
      view; only the AlphaEarth years not yet held are fetched).
    - Click a hexagon for its story: what WSF says, when AlphaEarth saw the
      ground change. `L` toggles the basemap labels, `F`
      full screen.

    The two year fills share one palette: a hexagon that is the same color on
    **WSF build year** and **AEF change year** is a hexagon where the
    settlement record and the embedding agree on the year.

    The hexagons fold from zoom 9 up and run to res 12 (about three pixels
    of either source) past zoom 14.6. Below zoom 9 the right pane shows the
    WSF pyramid (the earliest built-up date under each pixel) and the left
    keeps the mosaic down to zoom 7.
